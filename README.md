# 🚀 DeepSeek Code Companion 🤖  

*Your AI-powered coding buddy that never sleeps (unless you turn off the server 😆)!*  

## 🎯 What is this?  
DeepSeek Code Companion is a **Groq-powered** AI chatbot built with **Streamlit**, designed to assist with code generation, debugging, and answering your deep, existential programming questions (like why semicolons are still a thing in JavaScript 🤷‍♂️).  

## 🛠️ Features  
✅ **Smart Code Suggestions** – Because copying from Stack Overflow is *so last year*!  
✅ **Bug Whisperer** – Debugging made easy (or at least less painful).  
✅ **Syntax Guru** – Never forget that missing bracket again!  
✅ **Fast & Lightweight** – Runs on Groq and Streamlit for a smooth experience.
